# Skin-Cancer-Detector
An AI model that can detect if the given skin image has a type of cancer or not.

You will be able to get the model file after running skin_cancer_detection_model.ipynb on your own.
Unfortunately, the file size is too large, so it cannot be uploaded to GitHub.

Running the Application:
streamlit run main.py
